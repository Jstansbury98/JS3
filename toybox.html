                <h3>Toybox Profiles</h3>
                <p>Toybox Circus has been running for around 15 years and has had members from all areas in Chorlton. We strive to deliver a professional but also fun service. Some of our members over the years have gone on to become circus professionals themselves and have had students leave us to go train at The National Centre for Circus Arts as well as Rotterdam Circus School.</p>
                <p>Our staff teach primarily manipulation (hand-held) skills such as Feather Balancing, Plate Spinning, Juggling, Diabolo, Flower Sticks, Hula Hoop, and Poi, but also equilibristic (balance) skills from Unicycling through to Stilts, Rolla Bolla, and Acrobalance.</p>
                <p>Through a mixture of games and group teaching, young people are able to share in the fun of learning circus in a safe, controlled space. We encourage peer teaching and have 3 members of staff who started as members of our Youth Circus. Circus can be silly and serious, but we keep the silly out of the serious to ensure all young people understand the safety elements of any skills that we teach to ensure that accidents are minimised.</p>

                <h4>Martin</h4>
                <p>Unicyclist, Juggler, Youthworker, Scouter, Family Woodworker, Veggie, Trained by Owen, Ex-Bike Mechanic, Environmentalist.</p>
                <p>Martin comes from a scouting family background, and this was where he had his first taste of circus. Later in life, as an adult, Martin became immersed in the world of poi spinning and started to attend juggling conventions, where he began practicing and learning new skills. This led him to perform at events, where he met Owen Gaynor and was offered a role teaching at Toybox due to the former member of staff starting a tour with Nofit State Circus.</p>
                <p>After a number of years serving as Toybox's support staff, the opportunity was given to lead the Toybox sessions and be Unity's main circus staff member. Martin now has a team of four staff whose skills are broad and varied to fit all aspects of circus teaching at Toybox.</p>

                <h4>Pete</h4>
                <p>Youthworker, Juggler, Yoga Practitioner, Contact Juggler, Deep Knowledge of Juggling History.</p>
                <p>Pete has 20+ years of experience as a juggler and youthworker. He holds an in-depth knowledge of circus history and theory, making him a remarkable resource for circus tuition. Combining the knowledge of circus with physical skill means we can truly help our young people grow both mentally and physically. Pete is a yoga practitioner and manages to bring this focus into his teaching of contact juggling and other skills.</p>

                <h4>Molly</h4>
                <p>Juggler, Trained from the Ranks, Aerialist, Acrobalance Artist, Appeared on Blue Peter.</p>
                <p>Molly started her circus story as a Toybox Youth Circus member. She, among other Toybox members, was part of the Cat Scheme that pushed her training to learn with outside artists, which really focused Mollyâ€™s practice and gave her a great teaching and performing style as a young person. She honed her skills by working for multiple circus organisations. Molly is a genuine all-rounder and has equally good manipulation skills as she has aerial and equilibristic skills. She is a fantastically passionate teacher and established performer in her own right, having performed at large-scale events such as MCR Day and appearing on shows like Blue Peter.</p>

                <h4>Morgan</h4>
                <p>Trainee Youthworker, Circus Story Started as a Member of Toybox Circus, Taught by Owen Gaynor of TCH MCR, Along with Ryan and Molly.</p>
                <p>Morgan is our newest member of staff, who once again started as a Toybox young person but also spent a long time assisting in Toybox as a volunteer. As a proud member of the LGBT community, Morgan helps to add to the diversity of our varied staff. Over the years, Morgan has proven himself as an invaluable member of staff with a fantastic eye for detail, which has led him to become more than circus staff. Following in Martin's footsteps, Morgan has started on the road to becoming a qualified youthworker.</p>

                <h4>Ryan</h4>
                <p>Unicyclist, Juggler, Acrobalance Base, Molly's Acro Partner, Works in the Events Industry, Toybox Young Person.</p>
                <p>Ryan was one of our first young people to become a staff member. As a Toybox member, he showed his passion for learning and sharing circus skills. He is an extremely strong acrobalance base and worked as Molly's acro partner for some time. Ryan has an excellent eye for detail and can work a room very well to ensure that all young people are involved in a session and that no one is left behind in a skill. Ryan was also involved in the Cat Scheme, which allowed him to learn from many different circus trainers as a young person. This has given him a wide skill set that he is able to perform and pass on as a circus trainer.</p>
